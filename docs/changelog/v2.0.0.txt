v2.0.0

----------------------------------------------------------------------

replace the library: '@warren-bank/lz4-wasm'
  https://github.com/warren-bank/node-lz4-wasm

with the library: '@warren-bank/lz4-hc-wasm'
  https://github.com/warren-bank/node-lz4-hc-wasm

notes:
======
* for 'unpack'
  - decompression worked with both libraries
* for 'pack'
  - compression with '@warren-bank/lz4-wasm'
    * uses lz4
    * does not work
  - compression with '@warren-bank/lz4-hc-wasm'
    * uses lz4hc
    * does work
    * compression level 9 is used, because:
      - this is the level chosen by `pyxamstore`
        * cross-reference:

      - this is the level used by `Xamarin`
        * cross-reference:
